Why? The question above all others. Very rarely do I have an answer to this question. In the rare instance that I feel as though I have answered properly; time usually has a way of proving me wrong. Why did I quit my lucrative career as a Petroleum Engineer to become a Software Engineer? The answer can vary wildly depending on when I am asked. 

I could take the reader all the way back in time to middle school when I first got introduced to HTMl. Or maybe to the summer in the mid-2000’s after the Army when I worked at a technology camp teaching kids robotics and basic C++ (and also trying to teach them how to exercise!). It could be the years I have spent watching my wife create her own business in digital marketing. 

In the end, they are all waypoints on my journey of self-discovery. The most recent defining moment in my life was two years ago when, 10 days after I found out that my wife was pregnant, we discovered that she had cancer. In one moment of time, my life’s trajectory completely changed. The ways that I believed I was taking care of my family - working long hours, traveling 60% of my life to make lots of money, all while ignoring the ways my chosen industry was helping to destroy the planet - were no longer important. My eyes were opened up to the fact that that I could, nay should be, spending more time with the ones who are important to me. 

I spent a significant portion of the last two years helping my wife through chemotherapy and radiation treatments, seven surgeries, pregnancy, birth of our beautiful baby girl, and many other life changes. During that time, I realized that I did not like my current career path. Then it became, what do I want to do with my life? Enter software engineering. 

Now we make a big loop back to the moments I mentioned above, plus many others. The times that I found myself on the periphery of taking the leap into software engineering but could never do it - for whatever reason. Each time I told myself a different reason that I could not make such a dramatic change. And each time I have learned those reasons were weak and wrong. 

2020 is the year that I decided to take back the things that are important to me. Time with my family, working in an industry that I can be proud of, become more healthy (get back on the bike!), and software engineering is the base that will allow me to achieve those goals.
